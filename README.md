#Lightning Garadge

Welcome to Lightning Garage! This website is a project I created for practice using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a testament to my growing skills in web development and showcases my ability to build interactive and visually appealing web pages. By working on Lightning Garage, I've honed my understanding of front-end technologies and improved my problem-solving abilities. I hope you enjoy exploring the site as much as I enjoyed building it!
